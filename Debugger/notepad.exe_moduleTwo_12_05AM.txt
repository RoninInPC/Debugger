HeapAlloc:
argument number 0:
hHeap - HANDLE, A handle to the heap from which the memory will be allocated.This handle is returned by the HeapCreate or GetProcessHeap function.: 2700000

argument number 1:
dwFlags - DWORD, The heap allocation options. Specifying any of these values will override the corresponding value specified when the heap was created with HeapCreate.This parameter can be one or more of values. 0 - NULL

argument number 2:
dwBytes - SIZE_T, The number of bytes to be allocated.: 128

HeapAlloc
RETURN PARSING VALUE:
Ans of function - PVOID of allocated heap. If an error has occurred, it will NULL: 27093E0

HeapSize:
CALL ADDRESS:

HeapSize:
argument number 0:
hHeap - HANDLE, A handle to the heap whose memory block is to be freed.This handle is returned by either the HeapCreate or GetProcessHeap function.: 2700000

argument number 1:
dwFlags - DWORD, The heap allocation options. Specifying any of these values will override the corresponding value specified when the heap was created with HeapCreate.This parameter can be one or more of values. 1 - HEAP_NO_SERIALIZE

argument number 2:
lpMem - PVOID, A pointer to the memory block to be freed.This pointer is returned by the HeapAlloc or HeapReAlloc functionThis pointer can be NULL.: 271CCC0

HeapSize
RETURN PARSING VALUE:
Ans of function - If the function succeeds, the return VALUE is the requested size of the allocated memory block, in bytes.If the function fails, the return VALUE is -1: 5092
